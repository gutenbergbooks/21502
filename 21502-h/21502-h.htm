	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Some</span> two thousand years ago the
	greatest teacher who ever walked
	the earth advised the people of
	Judea not to build their houses on the
	sand. What he had in mind was that they
	were looking too much to the structure
	above ground, and too little to the spiritual
	forces which must be the foundation
	of any structure which is to stand.
	Following the war we enjoyed the greatest
	prosperity this country has ever witnessed;&#8212;the
	greatest activity, the greatest
	bank clearings, the greatest foreign trade,
	the greatest railroad gross earnings, the
	highest commodity prices.</p>

	<p>We then constructed a ten-story building
	on a foundation meant for only a two
	or three story building. Hence the problem
	confronting us business men is to
	strengthen the foundation or else see the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"></a>structure fall. I am especially glad of the
	opportunity to write for business men.
	There are two reasons:&#8212;first, because I
	feel that the business men are largely responsible
	for having this ten-story structure
	on a foundation made for one of only
	two or three stories; secondly, because I
	believe such men alone have the vision, the
	imagination and the ability to strengthen
	the foundation and prevent the structure
	from falling.</p>

	<p>The fact is, we have become crazy over
	material things. We are looking only at
	the structure above ground. We are trying
	to get more smoke from the chimney.
	We are looking at space instead of service,
	at profits instead of volume. With our
	eyes focused on the structure above
	ground, we have lost sight of those human
	resources, thrift, imagination, integrity,
	vision and faith which make the structure
	possible. I feel that only by the business
	men can this foundation be strengthened
	before the inevitable fall comes.</p>

	<p>When steel rails were selling at $55
	a ton, compared with only $25 a ton
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"></a>a few years previous, our steel plants
	increased their capacity twenty-five per
	cent. Increased demand, you say? No,
	the figures don&#8217;t show it. Only thirty-one
	million tons were produced in 1919, compared
	with thirty-nine million tons in
	1916. People have forgotten the gospel
	of service. The producing power per
	man has fallen off from fifteen to twenty
	per cent. We have all been keen on developing
	consumption. We have devoted
	nine-tenths of our thought, energy
	and effort to developing consumption.
	This message is to beg of every reader to
	give more thought to developing production,
	to the reviving of a desire to produce
	and the realization of joy in production.</p>

	<p>We are spending millions and millions
	in every city to develop the good-will of
	customers, to develop in customers a desire
	to buy. This is all well and good, but we
	can&#8217;t continue to go in one direction indefinitely.
	We cannot always get steam out
	of the boiler without feeding the furnace.
	The time has come when in our own interests,
	in the interests of our communities,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>our industry, and of the nation itself, for
	a while we must stop adding more stories
	to this structure. Instead, we must
	strengthen the foundations upon which the
	entire structure rests.</p>

	Honesty or Steel Doors?</h2>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

	<p class="chapter_summary"><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>While fifty-one per cent of the people have
	their eyes on the goal of integrity, our investments
	are secure; but with fifty-one per cent of
	them headed in the wrong direction, our investments
	are valueless. The first fundamental of
	prosperity is Integrity.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a><span class="first_word">While</span> on a recent visit to Chicago,
	I was taken by the president
	of one of the largest banks
	to see his new safety deposit vaults. He
	described these&#8212;as bank presidents will&#8212;as
	the largest and most marvellous vaults
	in the city. He expatiated on the heavy
	steel doors and the various electrical and
	mechanical contrivances which protect the
	stocks and bonds deposited in the institution.</p>

	<p>While at the bank a person came in to
	rent a box. He made the arrangements
	for the box, and a box was handed to him.
	In it he deposited some stocks and bonds
	which he took from his pocket. Then the
	clerk who had charge of the vaults went
	to a rack on the wall and took out a key
	and gave it to the man who had rented the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>box. The man then put the box into one
	of the little steel compartments, shut the
	door and turned the key. He then went
	away feeling perfectly secure on account
	of those steel doors and various mechanical
	and electrical contrivances existing to protect
	his wealth.</p>

	<p>I did not wish to give him a sleepless
	night so I said nothing; but I couldn&#8217;t
	help thinking how easy it would have been
	for that poorly-paid, humpbacked clerk
	to make a duplicate of that key before he
	delivered it to the renter of that box.
	With such a duplicate, the clerk could
	have made that man penniless within a few
	minutes after he had left the building.
	The great steel door and the electrical and
	mechanical contrivances would have been
	absolutely valueless.</p>

	<p>Of course the point I am making is that
	the real security which that great bank in
	Chicago had to offer its clientele lay not in
	the massive stone columns in front of its
	structure; nor in the heavy steel doors;
	nor the electrical and mechanical contrivances.
	The real strength of that institution
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>rested in the honesty,&#8212;the absolute
	integrity&#8212;of its clerks.</p>

	<p class="thought_break">******</p>

	<p>That afternoon I was talking about the
	matter with a business man. We were
	discussing securities, earnings and capitalization.
	He seemed greatly troubled by
	the mass of figures before him. I said to
	him: &#8220;Instead of pawing over these earnings
	and striving to select yourself the
	safest bond, you will do better to go to a
	reliable banker or bond-house and leave
	the decision with him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mr. Jones,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;tell me the
	truth! After you buy a bond or a stock
	certificate, do you ever take the trouble to
	see if it is signed and countersigned properly?
	Moreover, if you find it signed, is
	there any way by which you may know
	whether the signature is genuine or
	forged?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t. I am absolutely
	dependent on the integrity of the
	bankers from whom I buy the securities.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And when you think of it, there is really
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>no value at all in the pieces of paper which
	one so carefully locks up in these safety
	deposit boxes. There is no value at all in
	the bank-book which we so carefully cherish.
	There is no value at all in those deeds
	and mortgages upon which we depend so
	completely. The value rests <em>first</em>, in the
	integrity of the lawyers, clerks and stenographers
	who draw up the papers; <em>secondly</em>,
	in the integrity of the officers who sign the
	documents; <em>thirdly</em>, in the integrity of the
	courts and judges which would enable us
	to enforce our claims; and <em>finally</em>, in the
	integrity of the community which would
	determine whether or not the orders of the
	court will be executed.</p>

	<p>These things which we look upon as of
	great value:&#8212;the stocks, bonds, bank-books,
	deeds, mortgages, insurance policies,
	etc., are merely nothing. While
	fifty-one per cent. of the people have their
	eyes on the goal of Integrity, our investments
	are secure; but with fifty-one per
	cent. of them headed in the wrong direction,
	our investments are valueless. So
	the first fundamental of prosperity is integrity.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>Without it there is no civilization,
	there is no peace, there is no
	security, there is no safety. Mind you
	also that this applies just as much to the
	man who is working for wages as to the
	capitalist and every owner of property.</p>

	<p>Integrity, however, is very much broader
	than the above illustration would indicate.
	Integrity applies to many more things
	than to money. Integrity requires the
	seeking after, as well as the dispensing of,
	truth. It was this desire for truth which
	founded our educational institutions, our
	sciences and our arts. All the great professions,
	from medicine to engineering,
	rest upon this spirit of integrity. Only as
	they so rest, can they prosper or even survive.</p>

	<p>Integrity is the mother of knowledge.
	The desire for truth is the basis of all
	learning, the value of all experience and
	the reason for all study and investigation.
	Without integrity as a basis, our entire
	educational system would fall to the
	ground; all newspapers and magazines
	would become sources of great danger and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>the publication of books would have to be
	suppressed. Our whole civilization rests
	upon the assumption that people are honest.
	With this confidence shaken, the
	structure falls. And it should fall, for,
	unless the truth be taught, the nation
	would be much better off without its
	schools, newspapers, books and professions.
	Better have no gun at all, than one
	aimed at yourself. The corner-stone of
	prosperity is the stone of Integrity.</p>

	Faith the Searchlight of Business</h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>
	<p class="chapter_summary"><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>This religion which we talk about for an hour
	a week, on Sunday, is not only the vital force
	which protects our community, but it is the vital
	force which makes our communities. The power
	of our spiritual forces has not yet been tapped.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a><span class="first_word">About</span> three years ago I was travelling
	in South America. When
	going from Sao Paulo up across
	the tablelands to Rio Janeiro, I passed
	through a little poverty-stricken Indian
	village. It was some 3,000 feet above sea
	level; but it was located at the foot of a
	great water-power. This water-power, I
	was told, could easily develop from 10,000
	to 15,000 horse-power for twelve months
	of the year. At the base of this waterfall
	lived these poverty-stricken Indians, plowing
	their ground with broken sticks, bringing
	their corn two hundred miles on their
	backs from the seacoast, and grinding it
	by hand between two stones. Yet,&#8212;with
	a little faith and vision, they could have
	developed that water-power, even though
	in a most primitive manner, and with irrigation,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>could have made that poverty-stricken
	valley a veritable Garden of
	Eden. They simply lacked <em>faith</em>. They
	lacked vision. They were unwilling, or
	unable, to look ahead to do something for
	the next generation and trust to the Lord
	for the results.</p>

	<p>I met the head man of the village and
	said to him: &#8220;Why is it that you don&#8217;t do
	something to develop this power?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, if we started to develop this
	thing,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;by the time we got
	it done, we would be dead.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Indians had lived there for the last two
	hundred years lacking the vision. No one
	in that community had the foresight or
	vision to think or see beyond the end of his
	day. It was lack of faith which stood between
	them and prosperity. Hence, the
	second great fundamental of prosperity is
	that intangible &#8220;something,&#8221;&#8212;known as
	faith, vision, hope, whatever you may
	call it.</p>

	<p>The writer of the Book of Proverbs
	says: &#8220;Where there is no vision, the people
	perish.&#8221; Statistics teach that where
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>there is no vision, civilization never gets
	started! The tangible things which we
	prize so highly,&#8212;buildings, railroads,
	steamships, factories, power plants, telephones,
	aeroplanes, etc., are but the result
	of faith and vision. These things are only
	symptoms of conditions, mere barometers
	which register the faith and vision of mankind.</p>

	<p>This religion which we talk about for an
	hour a week, on Sunday, is not only the
	vital force which protects our community,
	but it is the vital force which <em>makes</em> our
	communities. <em>The power of our spiritual
	forces has not yet been tapped!</em> Our
	grandchildren will look back upon us and
	wonder why we neglected our trust and
	our opportunity, just as we look back on
	those poor Indians in Brazil who plowed
	with crooked sticks, grinding their corn
	between stones and hauling it on their
	backs two hundred miles from the seaboard.</p>

	<p class="thought_break">******</p>

	<p>These statements are not the result of
	any special interest as a churchman. I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>am not a preacher. I am simply a business
	man, and my work is almost wholly
	for bankers, brokers, manufacturers, merchants
	and investors. The concern with
	which I am associated has one hundred
	and eighty people in a suburb of Boston
	who are collecting, compiling and distributing
	statistics on business conditions.
	We have only one source of income, and
	that is from the clients who pay us for an
	analysis of the situation. Therefore you
	may rest assured that it is impossible for
	us to do any propaganda work in the interests
	of any one nation, sect, religion or
	church. The only thing we can give
	clients is a conclusion based on a diagnosis
	of a given situation. As probably few of
	you readers are clients of ours, may I quote
	from a Bulletin which we recently sent to
	these bankers and manufacturers?</p>

	<p>&#8220;The need of the hour is not more legislation.
	The need of the hour is more religion.
	More religion is needed everywhere,
	from the halls of Congress at
	Washington, to the factories, the mines,
	the fields and the forests. It is one thing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>to talk about plans or policies, but a plan
	or policy without a religious motive is like
	a watch without a spring or a body without
	the breath of life. The trouble, to-day,
	is that we are trying to hatch chickens
	from sterile eggs. We may have the finest
	incubator in the world and operate it
	according to the most improved regulations&#8212;moreover,
	the eggs may appear
	perfect specimens&#8212;but unless they have
	the germ of life in them all our efforts are
	of no avail.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I have referred to the fact that the security
	of our investments is absolutely dependent
	upon the faith, the righteousness
	and the religion of other people. I have
	stated that the real strength of our investments
	is due, not to the distinguished
	bankers of America, but rather to the poor
	preachers. I now go farther than that
	and say that the development of the country
	as a whole is due to this <em>something</em>, this
	indescribable <em>something</em>, this combination
	of faith, thrift, industry, initiative, integrity
	and vision, which these preachers have
	developed in their communities.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>Faith and vision do not come from the
	wealth of a nation. It&#8217;s the faith and
	vision which produce the wealth. The
	wealth of a country does not depend on its
	raw materials. Raw materials are to a
	certain extent essential and to a great extent
	valuable; but the nations which to-day
	are richest in raw materials are the poorest
	in wealth. Even when considering one
	country&#8212;the United States&#8212;the principle
	holds true. The coal and iron and
	copper have been here in this country for
	thousands of years, but only within the
	last fifty years have they been used.
	Water-powers exist even to-day absolutely
	unharnessed. Look the whole world over
	and there has been no increase in raw materials.
	There existed one thousand years
	ago more raw materials than we have to-day,
	but we then lacked men with a vision
	and the faith to take that coal out of the
	ground, to harness the water-powers, to
	build the railroads and to do other things
	worth while. So I say, the second great
	fundamental of prosperity is Faith.</p>

	<p class="chapter_summary"><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>Industry is the mother of invention. Struggle,
	sacrifice and burning midnight oil have produced
	the cotton gin, the sewing machine, the printing
	press, the steam engine, the electric motor, the
	telephone, the incandescent lamp and the other
	great inventions of civilization. Some religious
	enthusiasts think only of the &#8220;lilies of the fields&#8221;
	and forget the parable of the talents.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a><span class="first_word">A few</span> years ago I was employed
	by one of the largest publishing
	houses in the country to make a
	study of America&#8217;s captains of industry.
	The real purpose of the study was to discover
	some industry or some man that
	could be helped greatly through national
	advertising. In connection with that
	study of those captains of industry, I tabulated
	their ancestry. These were the
	seventy greatest manufacturers, merchants
	and railroad builders, the leading
	men who have made America by developing
	the fields, the forests, the mines and
	the industries. What did I find? I found
	that only five per cent. of these captains
	of industry are the sons of bankers; only
	ten per cent. of them are the sons of
	manufacturers; fifteen per cent. of them
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>are the sons of merchants, while over thirty
	per cent. of them are the sons of poor
	preachers and farmers.</p>

	<p>Why is it that ministers&#8217; sons hold a
	much more important place in the industrial
	development of America than the
	sons of bankers? The ministers&#8217; sons inherit
	no wealth, they have no more than
	their share of college education; they are
	not especially religious as the world measures
	religion. In fact, there is an old saying
	about &#8220;ministers&#8217; sons and deacons&#8217;
	daughters.&#8221; I would be false to my reputation
	as a statistician to hold up these
	captains of industry as saintly examples
	for young men to follow. But the fact
	remains nevertheless that these men are
	creating America to-day. Now, what&#8217;s
	the reason?</p>

	<p>The reason is that these men have a
	combination of the two traits already mentioned
	and a third added thereto;&#8212;namely,
	the habit of work. They have inherited a
	certain rugged integrity from their
	mothers and a gift of vision from their
	fathers which, when combined with the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>habit of work&#8212;forced upon them by their
	family&#8217;s meager income&#8212;means <em>power</em>.
	Integrity is a dry seed until put in the
	ground of faith and allowed to grow. But
	faith with works is prosperity.</p>

	<p>A man may be honest and wonder why
	he does not get ahead; a man may have
	vision and still remain only a dreamer; but
	when integrity and vision are combined
	with hard work, the man prospers. It is
	the same with classes and nations.</p>

	<p>It has been said that genius is the
	author of invention. Statistics do not
	support this statement. The facts show
	that industry is the mother of invention.
	Struggle, sacrifice and burning midnight
	oil have produced the cotton gin, the sewing
	machine, the printing press, the steam
	engine, the electric motor, the telephone,
	the incandescent lamp and the other great
	inventions of civilization.</p>

	<p>Why is it that most of the able men in
	our great industries came from the country
	districts? The reason is that the
	country boy is trained to work. Statistics
	indicate that very seldom does a child,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>brought up in a city apartment house,
	amount to much; while the children of
	well-to-do city people are seriously handicapped.
	The great educator of the previous
	generation was not the public school,
	but rather the <em>wood box</em>. Those of us
	parents who have not a wood box for our
	children to keep filled, or chores for them
	to do, are unfortunate.</p>

	<p>Run through the list of the greatest
	captains of industry, as they come to your
	mind. How many of the men who are
	really directing the country&#8217;s business
	gained their position through inherited
	wealth? You will find them astonishingly
	few. There is no &#8220;divine right of
	kings&#8221; in business. In fact, statistics
	show us that the very things which most
	people think of as advantages, namely,
	wealth and &#8220;not having to work&#8221; are
	really obstacles which are rarely surmounted.</p>

	<p>Industry and thrift are closely allied.
	Economic studies show clearly that ninety-five
	per cent. of the employers are employers
	because they systematically saved
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>money. Any man who systematically
	saves money from early youth automatically
	becomes an employer. He may employ
	thousands or he may have only two
	or three clerks in a country store, but he
	nevertheless is an employer. These same
	studies show that ninety-five per cent. of
	the wage workers are wage workers because
	they have systematically spent their
	money as fast as they have earned it.
	They of necessity remain wage workers.
	These are facts which no labour leader can
	disprove and which are exceedingly significant.
	This is especially striking when
	one considers that the employer often
	started out at the same wages and in the
	same community as his wage workers.
	The employer was naturally industrious
	and thrifty; while those who remained
	wage workers were not.</p>

	<p>The development of this nation through
	the construction of the transcontinental
	railways, the financing of the western
	farms, and the building of our cities is
	largely due to the old New England doctrine
	that laziness and extravagance are
	<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>sins. In some western communities it is
	popular to laugh at these New England
	traits; but had it not been for them, these
	western communities would never have
	existed. The industry and thrift developed
	by the old New England religion
	were the basis of our national growth.</p>

	<p>I especially desire to emphasize this
	point because of the position of certain religious
	enthusiasts who think only of &#8220;the
	lilies of the field&#8221; and forget the parable
	of the talents. It is a fact that the third
	fundamental of prosperity is Industry.</p>

	<p class="chapter_summary"><a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>Our industrial system has resulted in making
	many men economic eunuchs. The salvation of
	our cities, the salvation of our industries and
	the salvation of our nation depend on discovering
	something which will revive in man that desire to
	produce and joy in production which he had
	instinctively when he was a small boy.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"></a><span class="first_word">A few</span> days ago I was present at a
	dinner of business men in Boston
	who were called together in order
	to secure some preferential freight rates
	for Massachusetts. The principal theme
	of that gathering was to boom Massachusetts
	at the expense of the rest of the country.
	At the close of the dinner I was
	asked to give my opinion and said: &#8220;Let
	us see how many things there are in this
	room that we could have were we dependent
	solely on Massachusetts. The
	chairs and furniture are from Michigan;
	the cotton is from Georgia; the linen from
	Ireland; the silver from Mexico; the glassware
	from Pennsylvania; the paper from
	Maine; the paint from Missouri; the clock
	from Connecticut&#8212;and so on.&#8221; Finally
	<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"></a>I got the courage to ask if there was a single
	thing in the room that did not originate
	from some state other than Massachusetts.
	Those men were absolutely
	helpless in finding a single thing.</p>

	<p>The same fact applies in a general way
	to every state and every home. Look
	about, where you are sitting now. How
	many things are there in the room just
	where you are,&#8212;there is a table, a chair, a
	shoe, a coat, a necktie, a cigar, a lampshade,
	a piano, a basket&#8212;for all of these
	you are dependent upon others.</p>

	<p>The same fact is true when we analyze
	one staple like shoes which, primarily, are
	made of leather. Where does the leather
	come from? Just follow that leather
	from the back of the steer until you buy it
	in the form of shoes. Think where that
	steer was raised, and where the leather was
	tanned. Think of all the men engaged in
	the industry from the cow-punchers to the
	salesmen in the stores. But there is more
	than leather involved in shoes. There is
	cotton in the shoe lacing and lining.
	There is metal in the nails and eyelets.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>Not only must different localities co&ouml;perate
	to produce a shoe; but various industries
	must give and take likewise.</p>

	<p>Civilization is ultimately dependent on
	the ability of men to co&ouml;perate. The best
	barometer of civilization is the desire and
	ability of men to co&ouml;perate. The willingness
	to share with others,&#8212;the desire to
	work with others is the great contribution
	which Christianity has given to the world.
	The effect of this new spirit is most thrilling
	when one considers the clothes which
	he has on his back, the food which he has
	on the table, the things which he has in the
	house, and thinks of the thousands of people
	whose labour has directly contributed
	toward these things. Now this clearly
	shows that the fourth great fundamental
	of prosperity is co&ouml;peration, the willingness
	and ability of men to co&ouml;perate, to
	serve one another, to help one another, to
	give and to take.</p>

	<p>But the teachings of Jesus along these
	lines have a very much broader application
	than when applied merely to raw materials,
	or even manufactured products. As
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>we can begin to prosper only when we develop
	into finished products the raw materials
	of the fields, mines and forests, so
	we can become truly prosperous only as
	we develop the greatest of all resources,&#8212;the
	human resources. Not only does
	Christianity demand that we seek to help
	and build up others; but our own prosperity
	depends thereon as well.</p>

	<p class="thought_break">******</p>

	<p>When in Washington, during the war, I
	had a wonderful opportunity of meeting
	the representatives of both labour and
	capital. I had some preconceived ideas
	on the labour question when I went to
	Washington; but now they are all gone.
	I am perfectly willing, now, to agree with
	the wage worker, to agree with the employer,
	to agree with both or to agree with
	neither. But this one thing I am sure of,
	and that is that the present system doesn&#8217;t
	work. The present system is failing in
	getting men to produce.</p>

	<p>By nature man likes to produce. Our
	boy, as soon as he can toddle out-of-doors,
	starts instinctively to make a mud pie.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>When he gets a little older he gets some
	boards, shingles and nails and builds a hut.
	Just as soon as he gets a knife, do you have
	to show him how to use it? He instinctively
	begins to make a boat or an arrow or
	perhaps something he has never seen.
	Why? Because in his soul is a natural desire
	to produce and an inborn joy in production.
	But what happens to most of
	these boys after they grow up?</p>

	<p>Our industrial system has resulted in
	almost stultifying men economically and
	making most of them economically non-productive.
	Why? I don&#8217;t know. I
	simply say it happens and the salvation of
	our industries depends on discovering
	something which will revive in man that
	desire to produce and that joy in production
	which he had instinctively when he
	was a small boy.</p>

	<p>Increased wages will not do it. Shorter
	hours will not do it. The wage worker
	must feel right and the employer must feel
	right. It is all a question of feeling.
	Feelings rule this world,&#8212;not things.
	The reason that some people are not successful
	<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>with collective bargaining and
	profit sharing and all these other plans is
	because they think that men act according
	to what they say, or according to what they
	learn, or according to that in which they
	agree. Men act according to their <em>feelings</em>,
	and &#8220;good feeling&#8221; is synonymous
	with the spirit of co&ouml;peration. One cannot
	exist without the other and prosperity
	cannot continue without both. Hence the
	fourth fundamental of prosperity is Co&ouml;peration.</p>

	<p class="chapter_summary"><a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>
	We have gone daffy over things like steam,
	electricity, water power, buildings, railroads, and
	ships and we have forgotten the human soul
	upon which all of these things depend and from
	which all of these things originate.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"></a><span class="first_word">Two</span> captains of industry were
	standing, one day, on the bridge at
	Niagara looking at the great falls.
	One man turned to the other and said:
	&#8220;Behold the greatest source of undeveloped
	power in America.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No. The greatest source of undeveloped
	power in America is the soul of
	man,&#8221; the other replied.</p>

	<p>I was talking with a large manufacturer
	the other day, and he told me that he was
	supporting scholarships in four universities
	to enable young men to study the raw
	materials which he is using in his plant. I
	asked him if he was supporting any scholarships
	to study the human element in his
	plant, and he said &#8220;No.&#8221; Yet when
	asked for definite figures, it appeared that
	eighty per cent. of every dollar which he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>spends, goes for labour, and only twenty
	per cent. goes for materials. He is endowing
	four scholarships to study the twenty
	per cent. and is not doing a thing to study
	the eighty per cent.! Statistics show that
	the greatest undeveloped resources in
	America are not our mines or our forests
	or our streams, but rather the human souls
	of the men and women who work for us.</p>

	<p>This is most significant when one resorts
	to statistics and learns that everything
	that we have,&#8212;every improvement, every
	railroad, every ship, every building costing
	in excess of $5,000, every manufacturing
	concern employing over twenty men, yes,
	every newspaper and book worth while,
	has originated and been developed in the
	minds of less than two per cent. of the people.
	The solution of our industrial problems
	and the reduction of the cost of living
	depend not on fighting over what is already
	produced, but upon producing more.
	This means that this two per cent. must be
	increased to four per cent., and then to six
	per cent. If all the good things which we
	now have, come from the enterprise of only
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"></a>two per cent., it is evident that we would
	all have three times as much if the two per
	cent were increased to six per cent.</p>

	<p>Jesus was absolutely right in His contention
	that if we would seek first the
	Kingdom of God and His righteousness
	all these other things would naturally
	come to us. This is what Jesus had in
	mind when He urged people to give and
	serve, promising that such giving and
	serving should be returned to them a hundred
	fold or more. Jesus never preached
	unselfishness or talked sacrifice as such,
	but only urged His hearers to look
	through to the end, see what the final result
	would be and do what would be best
	for them in the long run. Jesus urged
	His followers to consider the spiritual
	things rather than the material, and the
	eternal things rather than the temporal;
	but not in the spirit of sacrifice. The only
	sacrifice which Jesus asked of His people
	was the same sacrifice which the farmer
	makes when he throws his seed into the
	soil.</p>

	<p>The story of the loaves and fishes is still
	<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"></a>taught as a miracle, but the day will come
	when it will not be considered such. The
	same is true regarding the incident when
	Jesus found that His disciples had been
	fishing all night without results and He
	suggested that they cast the net on the
	other side. They followed His advice
	and the net immediately filled with so
	many fishes that they could hardly pull it
	up. If we to-day would give more
	thought to the spiritual and less to the material,
	we would have more in health, happiness,
	and prosperity. The business men
	to-day would be far better off if&#8212;like the
	fishermen of Galilee&#8212;we would take
	Jesus&#8217; advice and cast our net on &#8220;the
	other side.&#8221;</p>

	<p>We are told that with sufficient faith we
	could remove mountains. Have mountains
	ever been removed or tunnelled without
	faith? The bridging of rivers, the
	building of railroads, the launching of
	steamships, and the creation of all industries
	are dependent on the faith of somebody.
	Too much credit is given both to
	capital and labour in the current discussions
	<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"></a>of to-day. The real credit for most
	of the things which we have is due to some
	human soul which supplied the faith that
	was the mainspring of every enterprise.
	Furthermore in most instances this human
	soul owes this germ of faith to some little
	country church with a white steeple and
	old-fashioned furnishings.</p>

	<p>The reason I say &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221;
	church is because our fathers were more
	willing to rely upon the power of faith
	than many of us to-day. What they
	lacked in many other ways was more than
	compensated by their faith in God. They
	got, through faith, &#8220;that something&#8221;
	which men to-day are trying to get
	through every other means. All the educators,
	all the psychologists, all the inspirational
	writers cannot put into a man
	the vision and the will to do things which
	are gained by a clear faith. Most of us
	to-day are frantically trying to invent a
	machine which will solve our problems,
	when all the while we have the machine
	within us, if we will only set it going.
	That machine is the human soul.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>The great problem to-day is to develop
	the human soul, to develop this wonderful
	machine which each one of us has between
	his ears. Only as this is developed can
	we solve our other problems. When we
	give as much thought to the solution of the
	human problem as we give to the solution
	of the steam problem or the electrical
	problem, we will have no labour problem.
	We have gone daffy over things like
	steam, electricity, water-power, buildings,
	railroads and ships, and we have forgotten
	the human soul upon which all of these
	things depend and from which all of these
	things originate.</p>

	The first step is to give more thought and
	attention to people, to establish more points of
	contact. Let us do humanly, individually, man
	to man, what we are trying to do in a great big
	way.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"></a><span class="first_word">I was</span> visiting the home of a famous
	manufacturer recently and he took
	me out to his farm. He showed me
	his cattle. Above the head of each heifer
	and each cow was the pedigree. The most
	careful record was kept of every animal.
	He had a blue-print in his library at home
	of every one of those animals. Yet when
	we began later to talk about the labour
	problem in his own plant and I asked him
	how many of his people he knew personally,
	he told me,&#8212;I quote his words:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, they are all alike to me, Mr.
	Babson. I don&#8217;t know one from the
	other.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Later in the evening&#8212;it was during the
	Christmas vacation&#8212;a young fellow drove
	up to the house in a fancy automobile,
	came in and asked for this manufacturer&#8217;s
	only daughter in order to take her to a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"></a>party. I didn&#8217;t like the looks of the fellow
	very well. After they had gone out, I
	said to the father:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who is that chap?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The father replied: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know;
	some friend of Mary&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The father had every one of his cows
	blue-printed, but he didn&#8217;t know the name
	of the man who came to get his daughter
	and who didn&#8217;t deliver her until two
	o&#8217;clock the next morning! That man was
	neglecting the human soul, both in his factory
	and in his home.</p>

	<p class="thought_break">******</p>

	<p>I repeat that we have gone crazy over
	structures above ground. We are absolutely
	forgetting the greatest of our resources,&#8212;the
	great spiritual resource,
	upon which everything depends. How
	shall we develop these resources?</p>

	<p>Certainly we are not developing this
	great spiritual resource in the public
	schools. The educational system was
	originally founded by the Church to train
	the children in the fundamentals of righteousness.
	Gradually, but constantly, we
	<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"></a>have drifted away from this goal and to-day
	the purpose for which our schools
	were started has been almost entirely lost.
	In some states it is now a criminal offence
	for a school superintendent to ask a prospective
	school teacher what she believes or
	whether she has any religion whatever!
	Under these conditions, is it surprising
	that the spiritual resources of our children
	are lying dormant?</p>

	<p>Much of the prosperity of this nation is
	due to the family prayers which were once
	daily held in the homes of our fathers. To
	a very large extent this custom has gone
	by. Whatever the arguments pro and
	con may be, the fact nevertheless remains
	that such family prayers nurtured and developed
	these spiritual resources to which
	the prosperity of the nation is due. The
	custom of family prayers should be revived
	along with many other good New
	England customs which some modern
	radicals may ridicule, but to which they
	owe all that they possess.</p>

	<p>The masses to-day are getting their real
	education from the daily newspapers.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"></a>Many of these newspapers have much
	good material, but the great effort of the
	daily press is not to make <em>producers</em>, but
	rather to make <em>consumers</em>. The policy of
	the daily press is not to get people to
	serve, but rather to get them to buy. Not
	only is the larger portion of the newspapers
	given up to advertising, but most
	of this advertising is of non-essentials, if
	not of luxuries. With this advertising
	constantly before the people of the country,
	it is but natural that the material
	things should seem of greatest importance.
	To remedy this situation is a great
	problem to-day facing the Christian business
	men of this country. What shall we
	do about it?</p>

	<p>The first step is to give more thought
	and attention to people, and to establish
	more points of contact. Let us do humanly,
	individually, man to man, what we
	are trying to do in a great big way. Another
	method to develop this human resource
	is to give people responsibility.
	Moreover, we must do so if the nation is
	to be truly prosperous.</p>

	across the street and that cat has the responsibility
	of some kittens, she immediately
	turns on the dog and the <em>dog</em> &#8220;beats

	We must give them a chance. We must
	give them opportunity. We must give
	them a boost. All of us are simply storage

	<p>I am quite often asked about investments.
	Well, there are times, about once
	in three or four years&#8212;during panics,
	when every one is scared to death&#8212;that I
	invest in stocks. There are other times
	when I advise the purchase of bonds. The
	fact is, however, that I have not made my
	money investing either in stocks or bonds.
	What money I have made has come from
	investing in boys and girls, young men
	and young women.</p>

	<p>There is a common belief current to-day
	that only people with experience are worth
	<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"></a>while. But I say: Quit looking for the
	experienced salesmen and trying to make
	a man out of him; get a <em>man</em>, and then
	make a salesman of him. I have a young
	man in my business who was delivering
	trunks for an express company twelve
	years ago. To-day he is my sales manager
	and has built our gross from $100,000
	to $1,000,000. One of my best experts, a
	man who is sought for by the leading
	Chambers of Commerce all over the land,
	was a carpenter on my garage nine years
	ago. Another one of my experts, a man
	the demand for whose services I cannot
	supply, never acquired recognition until he
	was over forty-five years of age. I found
	him keeping hens at Wellesley Farms! A
	young lady in my office to whom I pay
	$200 a week and who is worth, to me,
	$1,000 a week, I picked up at $4 a week
	twelve years ago.</p>

	<p>Such cases exist everywhere. You men
	yourselves know them. You look over
	your own organizations. Who are the
	men who are really doing things? Are
	they the men you acquired ready-made
	<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"></a>from other concerns? No! They are the
	men that have been taken up and developed.
	These are the men that have made
	money for you and have created the business
	enterprise of which you are the head.
	Yet when we have reached a point of prestige,
	and have a big business, we are
	tempted to say: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t time to develop
	any more people, I have got to get
	them already made.&#8221; This is a big mistake.</p>

	What Truly Counts</h2>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>

	<p class="chapter_summary"><a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"></a>
	The greatest resources in the world to-day are
	human resources, not resources of iron, copper
	and lumber. The great need of the hour is to
	strengthen this human foundation and you business
	men are the one group that can do it.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"></a><span class="first_word">When</span> it comes to the sale of
	goods, the same principle applies.
	Eighty per cent. of our
	sales organizations are devoted to selling to
	ten per cent. of the population. We have
	forgotten to consider whether or not goods
	are needed. We only consider whether
	or not they are being bought. We are
	forgetting to establish new markets, but
	rather are scrambling over the markets already
	secured. Tremendous opportunities
	exist in developing new industries,
	in creating new communities, in relocating
	the center of production from one community
	to another community to match up
	with the center of consumption.</p>

	<p>We have forgotten the latent power in
	the human soul, in the individual, in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"></a>community, in the different parts of the
	country. We have forgotten those human
	possibilities upon which all prosperity
	ultimately depends. I cannot perhaps
	emphasize this any more than by saying
	that the foundation of progress is spiritual,
	not material.</p>

	<p>The greatest resources of the world to-day
	are human resources,&#8212;not resources
	of iron, copper and lumber. The great
	need of the hour is to strengthen this human
	foundation and revive in men a desire
	to produce and a joy in service. Business
	men are the one group that can do it.
	They understand the emotions, understand
	the importance of the intangible
	things. They understand how to awaken
	in people new motives. So my appeal is
	not to wait too long to revive man and
	awaken the soul which is slumbering to-day.</p>

	<p>The nation is only a mass of individuals.
	The true prosperity of a country depends
	upon the same qualities as the true prosperity
	of its people. As religion is necessary
	for the man, it is also necessary for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"></a>the nation. As the soul of man needs to
	be developed, so also does the soul of the
	nation.</p>

	<p class="thought_break">******</p>

	<p>Let me tell one more personal incident.
	Not long ago I was at my Washington
	office spending the week. While there a
	little Western Union messenger girl came
	in to apply for a position. It was in the
	afternoon&#8212;about half-past five. I was
	struck with the intelligence of the girl&#8217;s
	face and asked her two or three questions.
	She was tired. I asked her to
	sit down. I was astonished to hear her
	story.</p>

	<p>She had been born and brought up in
	the mountains of West Virginia,&#8212;many
	miles from civilization. Her father and
	mother died when she was four years old.
	She had been living with an old grandfather
	and brother. When I began to
	talk with her I found her to have a most
	remarkable acquaintance with Emerson,
	with Thoreau, with Bernard Shaw and
	with the old Eastern writers.</p>

	<p>I said to her: &#8220;How is it that you are
	<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"></a>delivering telegrams in a khaki suit and a
	soldier cap?&#8221;</p>

	<p>She replied: &#8220;Because I could get nothing
	else to do. I lived down there in the
	mountains just as long as I could. I had
	to get to the city where I could express
	myself and develop my finer qualities.
	When I got to Washington there was
	nothing that I could do. They asked me
	if I could typewrite, but I had never seen
	a typewriter. Finally, after walking the
	streets for a while, I got a job as a Western
	Union messenger.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I wrote Mrs. Babson and made arrangements
	to have the girl come to Wellesley
	and work for a few months with the Babson
	Organization. I saw in her certain
	qualities which, if developed, should make
	her very useful to someone somewhere.
	She came to Wellesley. About a month
	after her arrival I was obliged to leave
	on a two months&#8217; trip and Mrs. Babson
	invited her up to dine the night before
	I left. I told her that I was going to
	speak while away on &#8220;America&#8217;s Undeveloped
	Resources.&#8221; After dinner she
	<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"></a>went to my desk and took her pen and
	scribbled these lines and said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Perhaps during your talk on America&#8217;s
	Greatest Undeveloped Resources you
	will give those men a message from a
	Western Union girl.&#8221; These are the lines
	she wrote. They are by Ella Wheeler
	Wilcox.</p>

	What Figures Show</h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>
	<p class="chapter_summary"><a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"></a>
	Panics are caused by spiritual causes rather
	than financial. Prosperity is the result of righteousness
	rather than of material things.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"></a><span class="first_word">The</span> large black areas on the adjoining
	chart are formed by combining
	and plotting current figures
	on New Building, Crops, Clearings,
	Immigration, Total Foreign Trade,
	Money, Failures, Commodity Prices,
	Railroad Earnings, Stock Prices and
	Politics in order to give a composite view
	of business in the United States. (When
	Interstate Commerce reports of earnings
	of all United States railroads became
	available, January, 1909, this record was
	substituted in place of the earnings of ten
	representative roads which had been used
	previous to that time. Revised scales for
	monetary figures were also introduced, in
	August, 1912.)</p>

	<p>The line X-Y represents the country&#8217;s
	net gain or growth. Based on the economic
	theory that &#8220;action and reaction
	are equal when the two factors of time and
	intensity are multiplied to form an area,&#8221;
	<a href="images/composite_plot.png" title="Large version of chart"><img class="image" src="images/composite_plot_thumbnail.png" width="200" height="128" alt="Thumbnail version of chart described in text." /></a>
	<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"></a>the sums of the areas above and below said
	line X-Y must, over sufficiently long periods
	of time, be equal, provided enough
	subjects are included, properly weighed
	and combined. An area of prosperity is
	always followed by an area of depression;
	an area of depression in turn is always followed
	by an area of prosperity. The
	areas, however, need not have the same
	shapes.</p>

	<p>It will be seen that each area is divided
	into halves by a narrow white line. This
	is to emphasize the fact that the first halves
	of areas below the X-Y line are really
	reactions from the extravagance, inefficiency
	and corruption which existed during
	the latter half of the preceding
	&#8220;prosperity&#8221; area. Contrariwise, the
	first halves of areas above the X-Y line
	are really reactions from the economy, industry
	and righteousness developed during
	the hard times just preceding. The
	high points of the stock market have come
	in the early part of the prosperity areas
	and the low points have come about the
	beginning of the depression areas. In
	<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"></a>1914 the war held down prices of all securities.
	The highest prices of bonds have
	usually come about the end of the depression
	areas and high money rates, and lowest
	bond prices at about the end of the
	prosperity areas.</p>

	<p>But what causes these fluctuations in
	business and prices? Statistics show that
	panics are caused by spiritual causes,
	rather than financial, and that prosperity
	is the result of righteousness rather than
	of material things. Hence, the importance
	to industry and commerce of the
	forces already mentioned. These spiritual
	forces are the true fundamentals of
	prosperity. This in turn leads us to consider
	from where they come and upon
	what we are to depend for their further
	development. The following pages will
	give the answer.</p>

	<p class="thought_break">******</p>

	<p>What are the sources of these fundamentals
	of prosperity? Where do we get
	this faith, integrity, industry, co&ouml;peration
	and interest in the soul of man upon which
	civilization is based?</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"></a>As already explained, we do not get it
	from the raw materials. We have always
	had the raw materials. We do not get it
	from education. From a statistical point
	of view Germany is the best educated
	country in the world. It has the least
	illiteracy. It has the largest percentage
	of scientific culture. No, these three fundamentals
	do not come from education.
	They do not come from the inheritance of
	property. I mentioned in the preceding
	pages the investigation we made of leading
	captains of industry in America, the men
	who head the various greatest industries
	in this country. Out of this group of
	men, only ten per cent. inherited their
	business, while only fifteen per cent. received
	special education. This shows that
	the source of these qualities is from something
	more than wealth or education.</p>

	<p>We are striving and even slaving to lay
	up property for our children, when statistics
	clearly show that the more we lay up
	for them the worse off they are going to
	be. If statistics demonstrate any one
	thing, they demonstrate that the less
	<a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"></a>money we leave our children the better off
	they will be; not only spiritually and physically,
	but also financially. When it
	comes to the question of education, we
	work and economize to give our children
	an education and to send our children to
	college. Yet statistics show that only a
	small percentage of these leading business
	men are college graduates.</p>

	<p>The success of individuals, the success
	of communities, the success of nations, depends
	on these fundamentals,&#8212;integrity,
	faith, industry, brotherly kindness and an
	interest in the soul of man. To what do
	we owe these great fundamental qualities?
	<em>Statistics show clearly that we owe them
	to religion.</em> Yes, and to the old-fashioned
	religion of our forefathers. Moreover, I
	say this not as a churchman. I would
	give the same message if I were speaking
	to a group of bankers or a group of engineers.
	I was first brought into the Church
	through the Christian Endeavour Society,
	but I was really converted to the Bible
	teachings through a study of statistics.</p>

	<p>To religion we owe our civilization and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"></a>to the Church we owe our religion. All
	there is in the world to-day that is worth
	while comes from men filled with, and
	from groups actuated by, these fundamentals
	of integrity, faith, industry,
	brotherly love and those other factors
	which come only through God. The
	Church to-day deserves the credit for
	keeping these factors before the world.
	Hence, it is evident that the people of
	America have not the bankers to thank
	for their security and prosperity, but
	rather the preachers and the churches.
	To these men we are obligated for our
	growth and development.</p>

	Where the Church Falls Down</h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Return to Contents</a></p>
	<p class="chapter_summary"><a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"></a>
	Become saturated with Christ&#8217;s principles, be
	clean and upright, co&ouml;perate with one another,
	have faith, serve, trust the Almighty for the
	results, and you will never have to worry about
	property. &#8220;If you will do these things, all of
	the others will be given to you.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"></a><span class="first_word">There</span> are two groups of people
	who criticize the Church. First,
	there are those who claim great
	love for their fellow-men, but do not go to
	church because it is allied with the property
	interests of the community. I believe
	that to be the fundamental reason
	why the wage workers, labour leaders,
	socialists and radicals are not interested in
	the Church. They believe that the Church
	is too closely allied with property. I have
	been severely criticized myself for presenting
	the Church as a defender of property
	and as a means of making your home, your
	business and your securities safer. Such
	critics are perfectly conscientious and the
	Church suffers much because those people,
	in their love for humanity, are antagonistic
	to the Church.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"></a>The second group are those defenders of
	property who look upon the Church as impractical;
	who consider the Golden Rule
	as something all right for the minister to
	talk about on Sundays, but something useless
	to try to follow during the week.
	Those men criticize the Church for preaching
	love, for talking the Sermon on the
	Mount, and for being what they say is
	&#8220;impractical.&#8221; So the Church suffers to-day
	by having both of these groups stand
	off alone. Neither of them is interested
	in the Church, the most important organization
	in America. It is the Church which
	has created America, which has developed
	our schools, which has created our homes,
	which has built our cities, which has developed
	our industries, which has made
	our hospitals, charities, and which has
	done everything that is worth while in
	America.</p>

	<p>Yet to-day, the Church is the most discarded
	industry of all, because it has not
	the co&ouml;peration of either of the above
	groups,&#8212;the radical group which claims to
	be interested only in humanity and not in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83"></a>property, and the propertied group which
	frankly says that it is primarily interested
	in property and not humanity. It seems
	that we should stop side-stepping this
	question. Instead we should face it
	squarely and answer both of these criticisms.
	My answer is as follows:</p>

	<p>Jesus was not interested in property, <em>per
	se</em>. There is no question but that Jesus had
	no interest in property. These things which
	look so important to us,&#8212;houses, roads,
	taxation, buildings, fields, crops, foreign
	trade, ships,&#8212;it is very evident were insignificant
	to Jesus. When any of Jesus&#8217;
	disciples came to Him to settle some property
	question, He pushed them aside and
	said He was too busy to consider it. I am
	sure that if Jesus were here to-day, He
	would tell us all that we are idiots for
	striving so to accumulate things&#8212;building
	ourselves bigger houses, getting bigger
	bank accounts and more automobiles.
	Hence, when the socialist or the radical or
	the labour leader complains to me, I
	frankly admit this fact. Without doubt the
	Church should emphasize that property <em>of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"></a>itself</em> is of no value, and the only things
	worth while in life are happiness and the
	health and the freedom which come from
	living an upright, simple life.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, and this point I wish
	to emphasize just as strongly, Jesus took
	the position throughout His teachings,
	that if His disciples would simply get
	saturated with His fundamentals, if they
	would be clean and upright, if they would
	co&ouml;perate with one another, if they would
	have faith to serve and trust the Almighty
	for the results, they would never have to
	worry about property. Property would
	take care of itself. Jesus emphasized,
	first, that they should not think of property;
	but He always closed His discourses
	by some such statement as this: &#8220;If you
	will do these things, all of the others will
	be given to you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>It is absolutely impossible for any individual
	to develop the above fundamentals
	of prosperity,&#8212;faith, integrity, industry
	and brotherly kindness&#8212;without being
	successful. I care not whether he is a
	doctor, teacher, banker, lawyer, business
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"></a>man or manufacturer. That same thing
	is true of groups and of nations. It is
	fundamental law, &#8220;Whatsoever a man
	soweth that shall he also reap.&#8221; Those
	who serve will be served; those who knock
	will be knocked; those who boost will be
	boosted. We are paid in the coin that we
	give. We are forgiven as we forgive. If
	we are friendly, we will make friends.</p>

	<p>Statistics show that the Church is the
	greatest factor in the worldly success of
	men, groups and nations. Some readers
	may have seen a book written by Professor
	Carver of Harvard entitled, &#8220;The Religion
	Worth Having.&#8221; In that book the
	author discusses the various denominations
	of Christianity. Then he says most conclusively
	that the religion worth having,
	the religion that will survive, is the religion
	which produces the most. Yet this production
	will not come by seeking production
	<em>per se</em>, but rather by the development
	of these fundamental characteristics which
	have been described.</p>

	<p>Try as you will you cannot separate the
	factor of religion from economic development.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"></a>In the work conducted by my Organization
	at Wellesley Hills we study
	the trend of religious interest as closely as
	we do the condition of the banks or the
	supply of and demand for commodities.
	Statistics of church membership form one
	of the best barometers of business conditions.
	We have these figures charted
	back for the past fifty years. Whenever
	this line of religious interest turns downward
	and reaches a low level, history
	shows that it is time to prepare for a reaction
	and depression in business conditions.
	Every great panic we have ever had has
	been foreshadowed by a general decline in
	observance of religious principles. On
	the other hand, when the line of religious
	interest begins to climb and the nation
	turns again to the simple mode of living
	laid by in the Bible, then it is time to make
	ready for a period of business prosperity.</p>

	The time is coming when the Church will
	awake to its great opportunities. The greatest
	industry in America but the most backward and
	inefficiently operated, is still in the stage-coach
	class.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"></a><span class="first_word">Of</span> course the Church is very far
	from developed. The Church is
	in the same position to-day as
	were the water-powers fifty years ago.
	The Church has great resources; but these
	resources are sadly undeveloped. From
	an efficiency point of view, from an organization
	point of view, from a production
	point of view, the Church to-day is in
	the stage-coach class. It holds within itself
	the keys of prosperity. It holds
	within itself the salvation and solution of
	our industrial, commercial and international
	problems. Yet it is working, or at
	least the Protestant branch is open, only
	three or four hours a week. The Church
	has the greatest opportunity to-day of any
	industry. It is the least developed industry,
	the most inefficiently operated, and
	the most backward in its methods.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"></a>Let us shut our eyes and look ahead at
	what it will be twenty-five years from now.
	Let us imagine five churches within a radius
	of five miles. All of them now operating
	independently. Each one open only
	a few hours a week. Twenty-five years
	from now these five churches will be linked
	up together under a general manager who
	will not be a parson, but who will be a
	business man.</p>

	<p>To-day the preacher of our churches is
	a combination of preacher, business manager,
	and salesman. He is the service department,
	the finance department and
	everything but the janitor. The Church
	is being operated to-day as a college would
	be operated with one professor, who would
	be president, treasurer, general manager,
	and everything else. The Church is
	being operated to-day as a factory with
	simply a production man and no one to
	tend the finances or the sales. Manufacturers
	reading this book know how long
	a factory could be run with only a superintendent
	and no one to sell or finance the
	proposition.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"></a>Twenty-five years from to-day, instead
	of the pastor being at the head of the
	church and a few good people doing voluntary
	work, there will be four or five
	churches of the same denomination united
	under one general manager. I do not
	mean by this that four of them will be
	closed. They will all be open much more
	than they are now; but they will all be
	under one general manager and will be
	taking orders from that general manager.
	Twenty-five years from to-day the
	churches will be self-supporting. The
	days of begging will be over. Religion
	has been cheapened by singing about &#8220;salvation&#8217;s
	free for you and me.&#8221; When we
	have our legal difficulties, we go to a lawyer
	and pay him; when we have a pain we
	go to a doctor and pay him; if we want our
	children taught we pay the price; but if
	we want our children instructed in the
	fundamentals of prosperity upon which
	their future depends, we send them to a
	Sunday School for a half-hour a week
	with the possibility of having them taught
	by a silly girl who doesn&#8217;t know her work.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"></a>In any event the parent seldom takes the
	trouble to ascertain the quality of the
	teaching.</p>

	<p>The time is coming when the Church
	will awake to its great principles and opportunities.
	The greatest industry in
	America is still the most backward and
	most inefficiently operated. When these
	four or five churches are combined, the
	preacher will not have to spend half the
	week in preparing a different sermon
	every Sunday. He will have two weeks
	or a month to prepare that sermon. He
	will have time and have the &#8220;pep&#8221; and
	energy to deliver it to you so you won&#8217;t go
	to sleep while sitting in the pews. The
	audience will then hear the same preacher
	only once each month, and the preacher
	will then have more than one congregation
	to appeal to.</p>

	<p>The same man is not going to be expected
	to preach on Love, Hate, the
	League of Nations, How to Settle Labour
	Disputes and the Health of the Community
	and every other subject. All of these
	men will preach the salvation of Jesus, but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"></a>each one will specialize in one particular
	phase of the Christian life, such as Faith,
	Integrity, Industry, Co&ouml;peration. Then
	we will take more stock in our preachers
	because they won&#8217;t pretend to know every
	subject. Then the preacher will not be of
	lesser intelligence than the average audience.</p>

	<p>Fifty years ago the ablest men in every
	community were the preachers, the doctors,
	and the lawyers. They were the
	only college graduates of the town and
	were looked up to. To-day, while we pay
	our salesmanagers from $15,000 to
	$20,000 a year, and lawyers and doctors
	large fees, we pay our preachers
	only miserable salaries. It&#8217;s a damnable
	disgrace to all of us. I often
	think that if Jesus were to come back
	to us, that He would take for His text
	that thought from the Sermon on the
	Mount, &#8220;If you have aught against your
	neighbour, before you enter into your
	worship go and square up.&#8221; I think that
	when He came in to speak to us on Sunday
	morning, He would say:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"></a>&#8220;Gentlemen, I suggest that before we
	have this service, we raise funds to pay the
	preacher a decent salary.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="thought_break">******</p>

	<p>Just before I went to Brazil I was the
	guest of the President of the Argentine
	Republic. After lunching one day we
	sat in his sun parlour looking out over the
	river. He was very thoughtful. He
	said, &#8220;Mr. Babson, I have been wondering
	why it is that South America with all
	its great natural advantages is so far behind
	North America notwithstanding that
	South America was settled before North
	America.&#8221; Then he went on to tell how
	the forests of South America had two
	hundred and eighty-six trees that can be
	found in no book of botany. He told me
	about many ranches that had thousands of
	acres under alfalfa in one block. He mentioned
	the mines of iron, coal, copper, silver,
	gold; all those great rivers and water-powers
	which rival Niagara. &#8220;Why is it,
	with all these natural resources, South
	America is so far behind North America?&#8221;
	he asked. Well, those of you who
	<a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"></a>have been there know the reason. But,
	being a guest, I said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mr. President, what do you think is
	the reason?&#8221;</p>

	<p>He replied: &#8220;I have come to this conclusion.
	South America was settled by
	the Spanish who came to South America
	in search of <em>gold</em>, but North America was
	settled by the Pilgrim Fathers who went
	there in search of <em>God</em>.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Friends, let us as American citizens
	never kick down the ladder by which we
	climbed up. Let us never forget the
	foundation upon which all permanent
	prosperity is based.</p>
